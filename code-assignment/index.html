                <p>Thank you for visiting <b>Chris's Place.</b> My passion for cooking started at an early age watching my 
                    dad create gourmet food. However, in the past few decades, I have worked hard to perfect my culinary skills, and I have a lot of help along the way. My dear friend 
                    Garrick Martin has been a great collaborator in my journey. June 2019, I lost my dear friend to a complicated heart condition. Garrick cooked around the world and 
                    had a dream of opening a barbeque in Majorca, Spain.  We loved to collaborate on meals every weekend. We shared ideas, techniques, and a whole lot of great tasting food. </p>
                <p>So, the main reason I am creating this platform is to provide a place for family and friends to find recipes and ideas. 
                    It seems like every time we cook, someone is asking for the recipe. Please check out my blog, “Chris’s Place,” named after my dad. I will be working hard to get 
                    content and recipes online as soon as possible. </p>
                <p>Regards,</p>
