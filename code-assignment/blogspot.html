        <div>   
            <p>
                At an early age, I remember going downtown with my father, on Saturday morning, to the meat market. I recall 
                the place was an Asian market with a meat market in the back. It must have left an impression on me because I 
                remember chickens and ducks hanging on a rack, feet first. But our mission was to purchase stewing hens for 
                chicken broth. So, three or four birds later, we were in the car heading back to the house.

                Now, you might be thinking, where’s that stock pot of mine? But you can put the stock pot away because Dad always 
                pulled out his secret weapon, the pressure cooker. It was a scary, thick-walled, sealed lid, pressure tank that 
                sounded like a steam locomotive when it finally got rolling. And that pressure vessel made copious amounts of broth 
                in short order. The process was simple: water, celery, carrots, onion, whole black peppercorns, salt, and fresh 
                off-the-rack stew hens. Dad’s recipe was simple, and it works, but I like adding some spice to my chicken broth.

                I don’t see too many pressure cookers out there, but I have to admit, I own three or four of them. However, in recent years 
                I have put them away for the new kid on the block, the Instant Pot. Yes, it’s a glorified pressure cooker; it can 
                also replace your crockpot and change how the world cooks. Okay, so here’s the essential, water, celery, carrots, 
                parsley or cilantro, rosemary, thyme (fresh, of course), tomatoes, onions – please leave the skin on, a head of garlic sliced in half, 
                ginger root, sometimes turmeric root (if I happen to have the golden jewel), red pepper flake, black peppercorn, 
                bay leaf, and kosher salt. Next, I use the soup/broth setting, and fifty minutes later, I have a fantastic broth that 
                adds flavor to anything I cook, not to mention it will heal whatever is ailing you. So, there you have it, Instant Pot 
                chicken broth.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have to tell you the possibilities are endless; we pull the meat off the bone and make soups, chicken pot pie, chicken 
                gumbo, and so much more. I am always amazed at how much homemade broth enhances the flavor of food. I hope this will 
                inspire you to try Instant Pot Chicken broth. So, make this your own, be creative, be bold, but most importantly, have 
                fun and enjoy the experience.

                Okay, you might ask yourself, what’s the difference between broth and stock? The short answer is this, the stock is a rich, 
                gelatinous liquid made from bones, and broth is a delicious-tasting liquid that warms your body from head to toe and makes it feel 
                like you're drinking pure health, made with love from meat and vegetables. You can find an excellent article by Lindsay D.
